# PRICE-PREDICTION-WITH-ADVANCED-ML-MODELS

Developed a Python desktop application featuring a Tkinter GUI that predicts asset prices for stocks and cryptocurrencies using multiple time-series models (LSTM, GRU, ARIMA). Integrated yfinance API for historical data retrieval, applied data preprocessing and scaling, and implemented ensemble predictions for enhanced accuracy. Delivered interactive visualizations, real-time stats, and multi-horizon forecasts with robust error handling and multithreading for responsive user experience.

•	Engineered custom neural network architectures with early stopping and model evaluation (MAPE-based accuracy).

•	Enabled dynamic visualization of historical and predicted price trends supporting tactical investment decisions.
